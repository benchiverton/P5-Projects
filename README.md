# lovingParticles

A JavaScript project which uses the P5 library.

Summary: 
-Particles 'chase' your cursor around the window.
-Basic physics have been added (e.g. particles bouncing off the edges of the window)
-It's nice and colourful!

Feel free to check out some of the photos of this program in action (also in this repo!) if you are curious.
